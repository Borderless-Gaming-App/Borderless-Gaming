## ‚ö° Overview  

**Borderless Gaming** is a lightweight yet powerful tool that transforms your gaming experience by allowing games to run in borderless windowed mode. Unlike standard fullscreen modes, this approach lets users switch between applications instantly without experiencing delays, screen flickering, or interruptions. This is particularly useful for streamers, multitaskers, and those who want to access desktop tools while gaming.  

The software provides robust support for a wide range of games, automatically remembering window positions and configurations for consistent launches. Users can easily add or remove games, customize settings, and benefit from the program‚Äôs intuitive interface. The automatic adjustment ensures that games fit perfectly on any display without manual resizing or adjustments.  

Borderless Gaming also improves performance for titles that experience glitches or instability in fullscreen mode. By reducing graphical stutter and maintaining smoother frame rates, it ensures a more stable and immersive gaming session. Moreover, the program integrates seamlessly with popular platforms like Steam and Epic Games, giving gamers full flexibility without compatibility issues.  

In addition, Borderless Gaming enhances productivity by enabling easy access to other applications while playing. Whether managing chat windows, streaming software, or browsing the web, the program ensures uninterrupted gameplay. Its combination of speed, stability, and user-friendly design makes it an essential tool for gamers seeking an optimal balance between performance and convenience.
